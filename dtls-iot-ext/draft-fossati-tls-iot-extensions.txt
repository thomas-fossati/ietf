       TLS/DTLS Optimizations for Internet of Things Deployments
                  draft-fossati-tls-iot-optimizations

Abstract

   Internet protocols work well in a variety of environments, including
   Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.  While there are some
   optimization possibilities to reduce code size, bandwidth
   utilization, and to improve battery lifetime, in general most
   Internet protocols are also applicable to constrained environments.
   TLS and DTLS are two such security protocols that can be used by many
   IoT devices since DTLS/TLS provide lot of flexiblity in terms
   credential choice, ciphersuite usage, etc.  The DICE working group
   has developed a specification that profiles the use of TLS and DTLS
   for IoT environments, without changing the TLS/DTLS specifications.

   This memo goes a step further and proposes changes to the DTLS/TLS
   protocol to introduce further optimizations.  Since the ongoing work
   on TLS/DTLS 1.3 already offers several improvements (compared to
   previous versions) this document focuses on the use of version 1.3
   and suggests further optimizations.

1.  Introduction

   Internet protocols work well in a variety of environments, including
   Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.  While there are some
   optimization possibilities to reduce code size, bandwidth
   utilization, and to improve battery lifetime, in general most
   Internet protocols are also applicable to constrained environments.

   IoT devices since DTLS/TLS provide lot of flexiblity in terms
   credential choice, ciphersuite usage, etc.  The DICE working group

Internet-Draft       DTLS/TLS Optimizations for IoT        November 2016


   has developed a specification that profiles the use of TLS and DTLS
   for IoT environments, without changing the TLS/DTLS specifications.

   This memo goes a step further and proposes changes to the DTLS/TLS
   protocol to introduce further optimizations.  Since the ongoing work
   on TLS/DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] already offers several
   improvements (compared to previous versions) this document focuses on
   the use of version 1.3 and suggests further optimizations.

   This document discusses four extensions, namely:

   Selective Fragment Retransmission:  This extension improves
      retransmissions of lost handshake packets.

   Transport Agnostic Security Associations:  Changes to a connection
      (such as an IP address change) requires a new handshake.  This
      extension introduces a transport independent identifier.

   Reducing the DTLS Record Layer Header Overhead:  This extension
      changes the record layer format to reduce the overhead.

   Reducing Buffers:  This extension allows a DTLS/TLS server running on
      a constrained node to indicate its buffer size.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Selective Fragment Retransmission

3.1.  Problem Statement

   The unit of retransmission used by the DTLS handshake is a whole
   flight (see Section 4.2.4 of [RFC6347].  If the underlying media is
   inherently lossy, or shows high latency variance that might fire
   spurious retransmission, a single fragment that gets lost or is
   excessively delayed will force the whole flight to be retransmitted.

   This is further exacerbated when the effective MTU is very low and
   therefore handshake messages have higher probability to be
   fragmented.  For example, IEEE 802.15.4 networks have a 128-byte MTU
   size.  In such an environment a very "ordinary"
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA negotiation can take up to 30
   individual fragments, 2/3 of which are sent in flight 4.  The loss of
   a single fragment in flight 4 implies a retransmission that is 20x
   the magnitude of the original loss.

   The retransmission timer settings suggested in Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-dice-profile] offer mitigation for the spurious retransmit
   issue and, in general, help with congestion.  However, they do not
   solve the retransmission of the entire flight.

3.2.  Proposal

   A potential solution is to add a NACK-based retransmission scheme to
   the DTLS handshake and the granularity of retransmission would be a
   message fragment.  We note that each fragment in a DTLS handshake is
   effectively associated to a unique identifier defined by the tuple
   Handshake.{message_seq,fragment_offset,fragment_length} that can be
   used in the NACK report to identify the exact geometry of the missing
   data in the current flight, together with the right-most received
   byte.

4.  Transport Agnostic Security Associations

4.1.  Problem Statement

   In DTLS, the security context demultiplexing is done via the TCP/IP
   5-tuple.  This implies that the associated DTLS context needs to be
   re-negotiated from scratch whenever the IP address or port changes.
   For example, when moving the network attachment from WLAN to a
   cellular connection, or when the IP address of the IoT devices
   changes during a sleep cyle.  A NAT device may also modify the source
   UDP port after an idle period.  In such situations, there is not
   enough information in the DTLS record header for a DTLS server, which
   handles multiple clients, to associate the changed address to an
   existing client.

4.2.  Proposal

   A solution is to negotiate, at handshake time, a transport
   independent identifier that is unique per security association.  We
   call this identifier the 'Connection ID (cid)' in Figure 1.  It
   decouples the DTLS session from the underlying transport protocol
   allowing the same DTLS security association to be migrated across
   different transport sessions.

              select (CipherSpec.cipher_type) {

   In order to negotiate a Transport Agnostic Security Association,
   clients include an extension of type "ta_sa" in the (extended) client
   hello.  The "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain
   the following ClientSecAssocData structure.

         enum {
             fixed(0), hotp(1), (255)
         } SecAssocType;

         struct {
              SecAssocType types<1..2^8-1>;
         } ClientSecAssocData;


   In the case of the fixed(0) type, the cid of the packets after
   ChangeCipherSpec is sent explicitly by the server.

   In the case of hotp(1) option the initial 'cid' is is calculated
   using the HOTP algorithm ([RFC4226]) as follows.

   o  A 20-byte string is generated [RFC5705] exporter.  The key
      material exporter uses the label "EXPORTER-ta-security-
      association-hotp" without the quotes, and without any context
      value.

   o  The initial 'cid' equals to the first HOTP value (i.e., the 31-bit
      value of Sbits in [RFC4226] notation), as generated by using the
      previously exported value as K.

   Subsequent values of the HOTP algorithm can be used in place of the
   initial, as long as they fall into the negotiated window_size (see
   below).

   Servers that receive an extended hello containing a "ta_sa" extension
   MAY agree to use a Transport Agnostic Security Association by
   including an extension of type "ta_sa", with "extension_data" being
   ServerSecAssocData, in the extended server hello.


         struct {
              SecAssocType type;
              select (type) {
                  case fixed:
                      struct {
                          uint32 cid_value;
                      };
                  case hotp:
                      struct {
                          uint16 window_size;
                      };
              };
         } ServerSecAssocData;

Internet-Draft       DTLS/TLS Optimizations for IoT        November 2016


   In the case of the fixed(0) type, the cid_value contains the value to
   be used as 'cid'.  In the case of hotp(1), the window_size must be
   greater or equal to 1, and indicates the number of HOTP values that
   the server can recognize for this particular client.

   In both server and client the DTLSCiphertext format does change after
   the DTLS connection state is updated; i.e., for the sending sides,
   after the ChangeCipherSpec messages are sent.  For receiving sides,
   after the ChangeCipherSpec is received.  The DTLSCiphertext format is
   changed for both the client and the server.  However, only a client
   can initiate a switch to an unused 'cid' value; a server MUST utilize
   the same value seen on the last valid message received by the client.
   A server which receives a 'cid' value which is not expected (e.g., a
   value outside its advertised window) MAY ignore the packet.

   A similar approach to support transparent handover of a DTLS session
   has been described in [I-D.barrett-mobile-dtls] and [Seggelmann].

5.  Reducing the DTLS Record Layer Header Overhead

5.1.  Problem Statement

   The DTLS record layer header adds 13 bytes of overhead, as described
   in Appendix B of [I-D.ietf-dice-profile].  While some of the
   information carried in the header is unavoidable, other parameters
   are redundant and included for backwards compatibility reasons.  This
   burden becomes quite substantial in networks with small frame sizes
   (e.g., low power wide area networks).

   Overhead that is not strictly needed could be removed to allow
   applications to transmit more data in a single packet or to make
   space for other DTLS features, such as the proposal described in
   Section 4.

5.2.  Proposal

   It is possible to at least remove the following parameters in the
   header:

   o  Protocol Version (2 bytes)

   o  The sequence number component of the nonce_explicit field at the
      AES-CCM layer is an exact copy of the sequence number in the
      record layer header field.  This leads to a duplication of 8-bytes
      per record.

6.  Reducing Buffers

6.1.  Problem Statement

   The Maximum Fragment Length extension [RFC6066] allows a client with
   limited buffer space to specify a different (smaller) maximum size
   for fragments that the server is allowed to send.  The mechanism is
   not symmetrical: a server cannot state their buffer size.  The
   assumption made in [RFC6066] is that the server is never going to be
   a constrained device, and therefore does not need such a capability.
   This may be true for many IoT deployments where the TLS client is
   implemented in an IoT device that connects to a server on the
   Internet that does not have memory limitations, such as a server in
   the cloud.  However, with the desire to also deploy CoAPS and HTTPS-
   based servers in IoT devices, a constrained node may also need to run
   a DTLS/TLS server.  In such a scenario, allowing a constrained server
   to advertise its Maximum Fragment Length helps to lower memory
   requirements.

6.2.  Proposal

   The semantics of the max_fragment_length extension could be modified
   to allow the server as well as the client to express their buffer
   sizes.

7.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank Stephen Farrell for suggesting the use of hash
   chains to implement a privacy-friendly connection id.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document suggests various extensions to DTLS/TLS and each of
   them comes with their own security and privacy considerations.  Since
   this version of the document only suggests strawman proposals further
   discussions are needed to specify the details.
